Most of their parents don't consider anything else other than IIT and stuff and those students who can't cross the gap end up leaving it all. Your point on friends - yeah, the present world friends are just like s**t (I feel lucky I've got a few good friends... Not all of us didn't make it to an IIT, but yeah, two of us - me and another friend of mine - are planning to get into th he nearest best college we can get)... they are all concerned on getting their life than pulling other friends along to the victory. I wish to see a ton lot of changes in this. And yeah if the educators could help those few students who can't get into the ""machine work"" (not exactly so, just try to make them unstoppable workers) mode do so, that's a lot good (even better if they could prevent suicides).","0","@samrubenabraham6979","true","false","false","false","","false",""

I was always studying with the fact in my mind that this portion has that weightage in jee then that portion has to be done for advanced etc,etc. And whenever I found a new concept it would not make my mind shine up with a 'WOW' like it did before... I would always think that so many students have learnt it and I haven't so I'll soon get out of the competition!!!! long story short....Finally in 12th now.... I left coaching midway in 11th and began self studying from books (and yeah giving tests ofc)... I can confirm I'm a lot happier in the process as of now.... once again i've fallen in love with science and found my true passion....Would never let it fade in this rat race ;) As per my opinion....

PARENTS GASLIGHT their children, set such terrible example of relationships that even as adults we're so afraid of repeating bad relationship patterns.   instead, in cultures where couples had some life of their own, traveled a little, fulfilled their dreams and experiences, they RESPECT their children as an independent adult and don't abuse them this way.","0","@ranirathi3379","true","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 year ago","Dear Sir,  I have enrolled in a reputable coaching institute that provides modules containing high-level questions for JEE Advanced. Approximately 100-120 questions per chapter are included in these modules. Additionally, they provide a CPP (Chapter Practice Problem) booklet for each chapter, which consists of questions at the JEE Main level. After completing these modules, they provide a work book that contains questions from four chapters, covering JEE Advanced, JEE Main, and board exams. The class notes also contain high-level questions, including basic and advanced concepts.  For physics, I rely on NCERT, exemplar books, and HCV (Concepts of Physics by HC Verma), as well as previous year question papers. For chemistry, I study from NCERT, exemplar books, and Disha's book of previous year questions. For mathematics, I use NCERT, exemplar books, Disha's book of previous year questions, and the Black Book.  I have also enrolled in an online coaching program called PW, where I am working on their modules. Although the questions in this program touch upon the required level, the amount of practice is sufficient. Is it necessary for me to continue with this additional coaching?  Apart from these commitments, I am unable to find time for additional studies, and the exams are held every 15 days, covering the entire syllabus. Considering these circumstances, should I refrain from pursuing postgraduate studies?  Thank you for your guidance.  Yours sincerely,","17","@flobixy","false","false","false","false","","false",""

I attended NEET exams for past 2 years(3 attempts) in first 2 attempts i was not doing my best but doing little preparation and didn't get the seat as i expected but this time i was so into the preparation but my love life ruined my mental health completely... The person who was with me for all my ups and down left me and i couldn't able to touch my book for the last 6 months and i failed miserably in my last attempt... I've never felt this much miserable in my life... My relatives' children younger than me passed the neet exams but me , daughter of TWO doctors couldn't able to achieve it broke me... I failed as a daughter it hurts so bad my parents spent thousands of money and my dad even when he had health issues will take me to neet institution daily every morning and afternoon all in vain....💔 I'll never forgive myself for breaking their trust and I'll never trust or love a person more than my parents here after...I'm tired of being depressed, as a single child it's my duty to take care of my parents I will work hard for them here after.","13","@euclix1601","false","false","false","false","","false",""

One of them got into ethical hacking and he has 3 backlogs. He earns like 5-6 lakhs every month, has his own car, bike and recently got a flat. Scoring well in exams, getting a nice job is a safer bet, but if you truly like something ""which is a valuable skill according to society"" and grind for over an year - you will have a much better life.

I've been through that and there was no one to help me out then few days ago I picked myself up said to myself looking in the mirror, ""Alveera I know this world is selfish, nobody cares about you, nobody gives a shit about you so what? Are u gonna end your precious life just for the sake of a person or a result? Like why Alveera how could you even think of that? You are really stronger than you think. Just don't think much and keep going. I'm always here with you for you.""  These were the words I said to myself that day and from then I never looked back :)  Now do you know what I do every night? I hold my hand tight, hug myself tightly and say ""Mai hu na tere saath re nasamajh bacchi sab sahi hoga tension mat le Mai hu apan sab dekh lenge.""   I know it's really difficult, I know it sucks!! But you have yourself and nobody can understand you better than yourself. So, don't beg to someone else for helping you out or to understand you and your emotions 'cause most of the times there will be no one 'cause humanity is dead among humans💔!!

At that time i ignored them and i didn't mind it because i felt it'll be good for me if I'll have less distraction around me. Friends who were literally like a family to me now don't even text me. I still remember when i gave my exam n wasn't able to crack it i became so depressed i felt like ending my Iife because i literally had nobody by my side  with whom i can share what im feeling. I'm a dropper now still preparing for my exam but deep down i feel i wish i could've changed my decision of not letting my friend go very easily and i wish i could've gone to school atleast i would've some memories but now i can't do anything about it except regretting. Even as of now i still have no one to talk and no one with whom i can discuss things related to my preparation.

But nowadays I'm  very much used to it. It has been over 2-3 yrs maybe having dry chats .But instead i more focused on myself. Still I'm  not that much of good completely otherwise i would not have just writing this comment. I have completed my 12th /attending . Even the coaching and school doesn't that much help in ur prep. Its just u. Coming back to topic,  Indian parents don't understand they just follow others if their son had joined that coaching then u should. I literally was yelled and even got beaten up  bcz i didn't want to join that specific coaching and all. Even if u dont get marks those same faculties see u as some non-sensitive , careless mf who don't wanna study. In school teachers are like If u get marks u are good and if u don't then u r not .   Now i have failed to clear my entrance , and again starting from 0. at this point of time I'm  very much used to family's teasing and all. But sometimes i feel that is is worth? That i sacrificed my 2 good years just for sake of not clearing exam .But still i just skip these thoughts as they wouldn't  help. My friends chilled tf out in these years , used to go to malls , theatres , literally flirting with every girl i thought that looked cute. but in then end we all just had same grades , still they now also not serious. And here I am constantly getting yelled 3 times. at the time of boards, at the time where i told them i failed to clear entrance exam , at the time where i didn't got some fking 90 % in boards.   But still im studying just to make my lifestyle very good , just to get some fking freedom , just to leave this shityy hell , just to make some very good friends that ican call besties/ homies bcz Im just a fking leftout + disappointment.  but now i have got a purpose in my life .I will work hard and overcome these difficulties bcz in the end it's just u and ur result/ ur job/ur hardwork nothing else.","4","@luciferwasabarowner6228","false","false","false","false","","false",""

Even teachers started to say that i am useless and a little problems at family too. But i have a fixed mind set i dont care what all say its just i feel that its completely normal and i am normal. I always keep in mind that life is not a straight like cuz even if your heart beat shows a straigh line it means you are dead. So it is normal for me to fail get low marks cuz everything that goes up also comes down and everything that goes down also comes up. This is life and change is law of nature so at any given time i should go on improving myself and exploring things going out of my comfort zone. The results might be good or bad but doesnt matter cuz its life. Ppl say you good when you are at your best and say you bad when you are struggling so dont mind it. Rather mind your own business.

But when you make videos like ""Perks of IIT tag"" saying that it gives respect in society, you said in one video ""There was a ticket collector who didn't ask for fine because one guy was from IIT travelling without ticket or something"". Saying out these things loud make it more depressing. You only know what the success rate is. I'm sure you may be just highlighting the positive aspect if successful, but believe me young, less mature minds take it otherwise. They think you're a loser if you don't make it to IIT. And there are coaching institutes too that say this loud.   Education industry doesn't really need to be this dark. Making it a business itself feels so horrible. It should be as socialistic as possible  Most importantly hustle culture is toxic and not good in the long run. The things about preparing for jee like ""No movies, no fun, only study"" will obviously kill the joy out of you and affect your mental health heavily.

Sure, it has many negatives but why nobody understands that in todays era, skills are the most required factor for most of the works. Why do you even have to keep a mentality such as not getting into your dream colleges is the end of your carrier? Grow up. These IITs and NITs are trully an achievements and there are awesome perks you get when you work hard 2-3 years of your life. But these are just an ""achievement"", not the final destination. If you think not getting into these colleges is stopping you from following your passion, sorry to say, you are just not really passionate about it.

So, wave them goodbye and keep marching to the beat of your own badass drum.  Education, oh education, the ultimate ""inject it or reject it"" dilemma. Who says you have to conform to society's educational standards? If it doesn't tickle your intellectual fancy, why force it? Embrace your rebellious spirit and question the status quo.

Actually I am interested in Rocket science, and I am feeling why can't rockets be built without studying those strange stuffs? It is the hardest course in engineering, why? Cuz of laaaarge stuffings are getting into the brain, which is very hard to take it. If anything is possible, building rockets can be made very simple, this is just an example.

"1 year ago","Bro...I have been going through the same mental trauma for 6 months....I m a 2nd neet dropper who started her actual prep in 1st drop yr nd cud complete only half of the syllabus....nd dared to take another drop with the hope of cracking both jee adv nd neet this time....in my 1st drop year I actually understood that jee is more about concepts nd the real phy (my fav sub)is taught not in neet but 2 jee students....the whole year I gave my every min into completing the jee syllb ( xcept maths...I thought if I get time after neet I will do something about it for jee adv)nd literally I was actually xploring the real phy...njoyd reading Halliday international version...solving irodov...pathfinder.. after watching nv sir jee lectures...I was just njoying the process of learning phy nd chem the  way jee students r supposed 2 learn....while I had to end up rote learning those mere phy nd chem formulae in my 11th nd 12th in a way I was never interested in during my inter sri chaitanya...but  my bad luck my hostel didn't allow us 2 use our devices /tabs...nd I had 2 do all this without anyone  knowing...eventually I cud complete only 11th phy nd chem but in a way enough for cracking jee adv questions....whenever I looked at previous year jee adv 11th phy nd chem qns I  felt so confident that I was able 2 solve them with such ease nd it enhanced my hopes for jee adv although I m a neet aspirant(pcb)....but I cud nt complete whole syllbs nd I messed up with my neet..which demands completing whole syllbs strictly....while in jee even with 50%syllbs u can actually hope for about 150 marks...that's what I felt...nd thus applied 4 jee mains xam session 2 but again my bad luck I missed my xam as nta changed the already twice nd I stayed with the same 1st address given by nta..it was so far...It cud actually take a half day nd my family unaware about my jee prep denied such risk...nd their denial made me cry like hell...I swear I never cried that worse as I did that day...this time I really wanted 2 take another drop just 2 complete my remaining syllbs all by staying home with the same nv sir lectures nd my old jee book stuff 2 crack jee adv nd neet both again.....nd this time requested my parents for home prep...they forcibly joined me in a neet coaching nd after a month I fought with them nd came back just 2 prove myself in both jee adv nd neet...which cud have been impossible in that neet coaching...I came back home with big dreams of cracking neet nd even getting great rank in jee adv which I felt was enough 2 remove that dropper tag of mine...this time I even started planning 2 prepare maths...collected req books for it...bought test series for both neet nd jee nd made so many plans but again 2 my dismay...I came 2 know that 2nd droppers can't give jee adv..not eligible...5 months left 4 neet now...I cud nt give even a thought about neet...I made up my mind so strongly this time about cracking jee..(its the toughest xam in the world nd cracking it with great rank is something that I wanted to keep as my lifetime achievement...nd cracking an xam like jee adv wud only remove my dropper tag which is thought 2 be a reflection of poor phy nd chem performance by many...moreoverthose r the sub I luv solving all this year I never feelt that jee adv is tough nut I was able 2 solve gud quality qns) that I broke down like anything....my father unaware of all this shit kept traumatizing me by his words about leaving a neet coaching nd prep online...staying home...he made me listen 2 all the shit that any indian jobless guy has 2 listen from society nd relatives...jee ad was like my love...I was craving 2 give it every day even though my mind was saying I can never give it now....every day I started waking up like a goaless person...the only thing I used 2 do all the day for these 4 months is searching for jee updates..any mere chance of giving it.as a 2nd dropper...moreover 2 my bad luck there were so many people nd online campaigns hppnd demanding for jee adv xtra attempt for 2021 12th passouts...as they r the actual covid19 batch nd they too deserved a chance just like 2020 ppl who were blessed with an xtra chance in jee adv on the name of covid batch....many court pleas...many campaigns but into vain....I felt so directionless...not even a single frnd 2 share my heart out...like literally no onnne...loneliness was killing me from inside day by day..nd boredom became my daily emotion..along with jee adv i was cravingfor atleast a single person whom i can speak 2 fankly withoit the fear of being judged....all I was having were an empty mind nd eyes full of tears due to everyday taunts by my father...he even used 2 leave his office midtime just 2 show his frustration on me....I felt like dying all these months...I really wanted 2 prove myself..I forced myself 2 prep for neet as only 1 month left now still failed in it nd cud not bring myself out of all that shit...I was like blind folded with that one xam called jee adv...like an insane person I was still surfing all the social media just 2 know about any chance left or not...anyhow Idk why I applied for jee sessn 2 2023 this time...with nil prep nd only 11th syllb which I prep in my 1st drop year half of which evaporated from my brain...nd managed 2 clear cut off for jee adv 2023...insanely hoping that something gud will happen as a case was filed in delhi high court regarding the xtra attempt...but on may 2nd 2023...court rejected  the plea nd that was my 2nd worst day of my whole prep days...only a week left for neet I started realizing everything now nd started revising 11 th nd did some 12th imp topics...I knew that I wont be able 2 crack neet nd on May 3rd I burst down like anything...had a mental breakdown like never before...remembering the shit that happened till now nd imagining the shit that's gonna hppn afterwards...my hands shiverd...I cud not control my tears for an hour...I wanted 2 stop crying but...nd seeing me crying like hell my mom called my dad in office 2 take me 2 hospital which I denied nd my mom took me   2 a nearby park holding my hand like that of a kid...I was still am uncontrollably crying....nd it all got ended on May 7 ...I know I messed up again in neet...with a very vague prep..that's same as zero syllbs....again listening the same shit from my father writing this comment that I am capable of nothing...I have 0 intellect...am a mere rote learner...phy nd chem r not my things..nd all the hell againnn...idk where my life will go but all that I learnt is xpectations hurt.like hell really...nd life never wants the way we want it 2 be...we never know what hppns..but one thing which was relatable in the vdio for me...was I did something which was against this education system..I enjoyed the process rather than the result..I always knew that I being a pcb student will never be able 2 enter any iit but that was never my dream yr...a mere rank in jee adv infact just giving it nd presenting all that I learnt in the xam was enough 4 me...but even that didn't happen....I know I spoiled my neet thinking about something I knew I wud never get...but all the shit I have been going through like my father's tantrums r my alarm clock all these days..I woke up with tears in my eyes...listening 2 his hell like words..when tears were heavy I finally woke up...this was my daily schedule...nd all I have 2 blame on  is me myself nd right now all I have whom I can emotionally depend upon is me myself...but now I have got enough guts to face whatever happens..","1","@chand_ni","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 year ago","Major reason for the system to be so stressful is overpopulation and the fact that education is absolutely nothing but a business. If we take example of iit jee, We have an extremely difficult exam (what we study in 11th 12th are things people study in their unis abroad whent they're majoring in a subject, I saw a video where an Oxford Math Major was solving jee advanced math paper and couldn't believe it was for high school students), now, this difficulty of the exam makes absolutely no sense. The exam is not good enough to decide whether you're qualified to pursue a particular course or not, it is nothing but a way to rank students because seats are limited (I'm sorry jee aspirants, but being able to do physics chemistry maths, does not mean you can code, Coding requires completely different set of skills). Now then, since all the system has to do is provide ranks, they can very well use even an easier examination for it to happen. But they don't, and as a result of this, all the money goes to coaching institutes. If we ignore the revolution YouTube has brought in academics, we all know that if you only follow your school teachers, you aren't getting anywhere in iit jee, and thus coachings become a must. Now let's talk about how long people prepare for this. I've seen a lot of toppers say they've been preparing for 4 years...SENSE? Instead of learning how to crack and exam for 4 whole years, if they learned the skills actually required for their course, India won't be a developing country still. I'm not even gonna talk about reservation. And most of the people might not know this, but if iitians apply for off campus placements to some foreign company, most of them are gonna be rejected because of lack of personal projects etc., yes, off campus placements mein they'll be REJECTED in FIRST ROUND. Let's take example of computer science. So if someone is applying for placement after a bachelor's degree, I'm expecting they don't really even want to get into research work related to computers like quantum computing etc., which means the main skill they'll be using is code, with absolutely zero need for whatever they studied to qualify the exam. Now let's say a person A and a person B. Person B's parents told him to prepare for iit jee and become an engineer, he worked hard for 2-3 years and cleared iitjee. He entered college, and followed the college curriculum, made projects based on the curriculum and only focused on keeping his cgpa high for placement, because that's what most people really do. There's no passion for the subject here or research work or to actually 'learn' about it. This person goes on and gets a job and contributes to the economy. Person A is very passionate about computers, he has done a lot of code, developed games, built PCs etc in just class 11 and 12. He obviously cannot get admission in iits or any good cse college for that sake as his time was dedicated to actually researching on the subject, not on studying esterification of alcohol which is completely irrelevant. He gets into a bad college, and his talent, passion, everything is wasted in India. So he works hard on top of college and does a lot of research, has a lot of projects, and applies to a foreign company off campus because indian ones are gonna run after iit nerds, gets hired easily, makes a lot of money, and on top of that, contributes to research and progress, but, of another nation. However, can you blame him? In India he wasn't offered an opportunity on the basis of his skill, instead our education system is using an exam which is almost completely irrelevant to the course to select people for that course, obviously they won't be able to acquire people who are actually passionate about the course, and this, India does not progress. A good solution for this would be to have different entrances for different branches in engineering, you can't lump extremely diverse stuff like mechanical, computer science, or biotechnology together. It makes no sense and not everything is pcm. Well we can't do much about population since so many people are ineducated, they will reproduce too much unnecessary and it's too difficult to impart knowledge to all of them, but we can atleast choose a better selection criteria.","1","@prachijain6077","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 year ago (edited)"," @schrodingerscat86  That's a good point, however since syllabus would be covered in schools, need for any reservations, and every student will be competing on almost equal level, plus, the way coaching institutes have made this exam a whole business, that will be gone.  However aside from this, the major point I stated in my paragraph was the we shouldn't lump things like biotechnology, computer science, mechanical, together as 'engineering' and take a unified entrance exam for them, based on pcm (irrelevant in computer science atleast if one is aiming for tech jobs), instead the exam should be based on particular branch you're applying for, different exams for different branches. I see people choosing their career based on the branch they get, or people aiming for the college, not the course, it's disheartening to see how someone who may be studying this particular course would have chosen something else if he got just a little more marks, where's the passion?  Whats your take on this?","0","@prachijain6077","true","false","false","false","","false",""
"1 year ago"," @prachijain6077  well said.. but the competition can never be on an equal level because then the school factor will come into the picture as some will study in really good schools and some are maybe in govt or not that good school as I myself studied from a govt school I know and Prachi as you said that PCM is irrelevant for computer science than I would not agree 100% with you and we study so much mathematics that probably will never be used in our life but we study it just to expand our thinking and our mind.. and PCM is used in entrance exam so that to test students how's there approach of thinking that's why JEE itself contains a lot of conceptual questions rather than just theoretical questions although I must say that for studying computer science you must not need to study PCM as maybe some student are weaker in PCM and strong in that particular area but it's very rare.. And as an engineering student I must say that you'll get plenty of time to persuade your passion if you are really into it as I have seen 100s of such cases in my batch itself and I'm also interested in graphic designing and I'm doing it.","0","@schrodingerscat86","true","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 year ago","In my opinion ,  I think that he education system is the way it is mostly by society, like , think about it , why are there so many engineering and medical colleges? Why are there so many students giving the JEE or NEET exams even though the amount of engineers and doctors more than the required amount? It is because society values them a lot , and it is also the online media that does it as well, society constantly told you , that without engg or medical , there is no life ,  your parents want you to go to these fields because someone in the society has become successful in that field and your parents are under peer pressure , it is the society that is the fuel to the fire that is burning . But remember, if you authentically want to go to Engineering or medical fields or that these dreams authentically align with your interests then , go on! Pursue them. And yeah , if you don't get into IIT or AIIMS , then don't be sad or depressed , there is a lot ahead to do so in life.","1","@Aryan-Swab","false","false","false","false","","false",""

We can see this in any edtech platform's comment section, kids abusing teachers. I agree we all can't understand from the same teacher but that doesn't mean u go and abuse them. The one who doesn't respect teachers never becomes successful. For us it might me fun but just think from teachers pov, how tough it's for them to handle it, they might not show it on their face but it hurts as they are humans as well.

My story so I never have plan of going to iit from my 9 10th I wanted to become lawyer it was so clear and when it came to 12th stream choosing I said to my family As am going to do absolutely law I will choose commerce but my bro and sis said choose pcm then u will many options I choosed then I started to face interest in coding and stuff and I thought k I will go to iit and I have planned everything after that job master all and my law dream went away even I didn't realized that and all was good in 2020 I joined 11th in srichaitanya and in 2022 it supposed to complete but I don't even know something will unfortunate change my life for forever in 2021 sep 14 my dad passed away which is terrible I couldn't take that and next month in Oct the boards were conducted ts as they postponed due to lockdown and I gave my exams and didn't go to clg next 6 months and I went into depression and my health also got affected and I didn't  gave my practicals and boards in may 2022 and when I want to give in June supplementary my luck was even bad I had a injury I got slipped in washroom and I didn't attended and this year I gave my exams yes 1 year wasted but maybe am not strong like other people and u may wonder I never thought of sucide or had feeling of wanted die of I had but I think last I thought what will happen if I really die by anychance ntg will happen this world not goan stop everything is gng to be k may be who loves u cry then all gos to normal so we are fighting for validation where we don't have and if we really want something we should fight for it sucide is not solution of saying this is easy but only they know how it feels like who goes through this phase but it a fact that no body cares for u when ur in pain even ur friends so sometimes its important to pick yourself up even u fall and i really learned about myself and life in this 1 year  Spending time with parents loved ones and making memories we are so busy we forget every one goan leave you one day  I explored many things which am very happy about it about myself  Before i used think what to do in life study job that's it may be going to abroad because everyone around has same plans I never knew that I can sing and play guitar well  I started to write my feelings in general because am a introvert with no friends of and I started to realize I can write so well I wrote 6songs about depression love validation  YouTube yes YouTube is my best friend for everything and I watched YouTube so much all languages telugu hindi English I started to question the mistakes in their videos so am thinking of content creation  I love coding so I absolutely do something for people who suffer from mental health problems  And am thinking of taking a break from studies as am about finish my 12th and explore more stuff about me my life  Meditation or sitting ideal for couple of min to give some peace who wants it I tried books can also change ur perspective it's not compulsory to have best to become successful in life u can be successful and best if ur best am referring to your knowledge bye if anyone read this long comment u really have patience then .","0","@unstoppable8838","false","false","false","false","","false",""

Some parents and relatives make the student believe that only marks matter and as they fail they are afraid of facing the problem and stupidly die. No place for sympathy here. Actually they should analyse where the problem is and they should have a ""Ready to rise"" attitude and should take the necessary steps. If some people are succeeding then how are they doing. Dont blame them if they have natural talent. Talents and skills can always be developed. Even a large textile owner's child is born without dress. Only because his/her father is a textile owner, it doesnt come out of its mother's womb as a fully dressed individual. They have to come out of their issues and should go on the path of victory ...    Dont blame anything else for your fate.

They make a quote that if they want they will learn. Actually the advertisements that they offer are just the one face of them, while still there is thousands of students who got avg marks. While they are caring the toppers and advertise, the poor parents believe that even my avg child will get proper care and guidance to become toppers, but actually not. The only word to describe all of this is Business and money. Even private colleges are giving seats for the fellows who just passed 12th through management. While students of average families working day and night for their dream, those who just roam are buying the seat and bullying the hard work of us.

During my 10th, college counsellors from 20 different colleges/institutions whatever, had come to my school regarding their sales pitch and the compulsive attitude of those people to make you join their college, surprisingly the counsellor only talked about having Science courses and the way of learning to crack JEE/NEET, and no college counsellor had even talked about Arts/Commerce, just Science, and those days still piss me off, as almost nobody has given importance to those students who take other stream rather than science. I am currently 11th and study MEC(Maths, Economics and Commerce).   You might see me as a keyboard warrior, but the truth is, I am just telling all this from me and my friend's experience.

Most of the successful people have not done well in school/college(AR Rahman, JRD Tata, Dhirubhai Ambani...)  Things to do:  Discover your potential (if your potential is to become a carpenter accept it gracefully, no need to pass so.many exams)  Develop skills: reading writing, arithmetic and one monetisable skill( carpentry, tailoring, tv mechanics...)  Build your career slowly, it is not necessary to graduate at 20 and get married at 25. You can continue education at your pace. Dr. Kalam's driver got PhD slowly and became professor much later in life!  Support yourself financially , become independent and secure first..
