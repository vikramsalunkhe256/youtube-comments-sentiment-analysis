## Insights and Recommendations

- **Mental health crises** fueled by **academic pressure**.

- A **commercialized education system** where coaching plays a central role.
- A call for **systemic change** to reduce pressure and focus on skills and life preparation.

The word cloud portrays the **highly pressurized**, **exam-focused nature** of the Indian education system, where **parental pressure**, **mental health struggles**, and **high-stakes competitive exams** dominate conversations.
